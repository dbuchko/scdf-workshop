== Prerequisites

. A local instance of SCDF.

. An instance of SCDF deployed on PCF.


== Using Skipper to Deploy a Stream to Local and PCF Platforms

. In your space on PCF, create either

+
* an SCDF service instance (which will create SCDF server, RabbitMQ, MySQL, and Redis service instances), or
* a RabbitMQ service instance

. Create a Skipper configuration file that specifies the platforms your SCDF streams and tasks will be deployed to. A sample file is shown, customize it accordingly for your specific PCF installation.

+
NOTE: Set the `spring.cloud.skipper.platform.cloudfoundry.accounts.cf-dev.deployment.services` to the name of your RabbitMQ service instance.

                  skipSslValidation: true
                deployment:
                  memory: 1024m
                  disk: 1024m

                  deleteRoutes: false
```

. Launch skipper, but add the path to your custom configuration file as part of the startup parameters.

+
```
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-1.0.4.RELEASE.jar --spring.config.location=file:///Users/student/scdf-workshop/platforms.yml
```

. Launch a local instance of the SCDF server, making sure that skipper is enabled.

+
```
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-1.5.0.RELEASE.jar --spring.cloud.dataflow.features.skipper-enabled=true
```

. Create a stream, then from the dashboard deploy it.  Note when the deployment parameters screen appears, there should now be a dropdown for you to choose local or PCF deplyment platforms.

. Verify deployment to both platforms works.
