Demonstrate how to create tasks and batch jobs in Spring Cloud Data Flow on PCF.  This lab is based on the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_batch_job_on_cloud_foundry[sample from the documentation].

== Prerequisites

https://docs.pivotal.io/scdf/index.html[SCDF on PCF Reference Documentation]

. Install the Spring Cloud Data Flow CF CLI plugins, as per the documentation.

+
```
cf install-plugin -r CF-Community "spring-cloud-dataflow-for-pcf"
```

+
```
cf install-plugin -r CF-Community "Service Instance Logging"
```
+
. Install the https://github.com/andreasf/cf-mysql-plugin#installing-and-uninstalling[CF MySQL CLI plugin].

+
```
cf install-plugin -r "CF-Community" mysql-plugin
```



== Creating a Batch Job from Spring Cloud Task

. If you haven't already, login to PCF and create the SCDF service in your space.

+
```
cf create-service p-dataflow standard scdf-svc
```
+
Once the service has been created, you should see output similar to the following:

+

. Launch the dataflow shell.

+
```
cf dataflow-shell scdf-svc
```
. Register the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-samples/batch-job[sample batch job].

+
```
app register --type task --name simple_batch_job --uri https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples/raw/master/src/main/asciidoc/tasks/simple-batch-job/batch-job-1.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

. Create the task with the simple-batch-job application

+
```
task create foo --definition "simple_batch_job"
```

. Launch the task.

+
```
task launch foo
```

. Tail the logs.

+
```
cf logs foo
```

. Verify the task execution details.

+
```
task execution list
```

. Verify the job execution details.

+
```
job execution list
```
